MovieMaster is a website that helps users find movies.

The objective was to create a movie catalog where users can check the movies of the week, 
search for movies and view details about them. 
The project was developed with create-react-app and had the Movie DB (MDB) JSON API for a data source. 
The global application state is created using Reactâ€™s built-in features: React Hooks and the Context API. 
Styling was done with SCSS(CSS Grid, Flexbox).
